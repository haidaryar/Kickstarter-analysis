# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis. 
- Conducted analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for Theater to help in the decision making process of a prospective Kickstarter platform campaigner.
# Overview 
- With data available for over four thousand and one hundred art campaigns I performed analysis of success rate against campaign start timeline as well as it's goal. 
- Potentially categorization of campaigns can be an issue. Campaigns to raise money for theater hall building and/or restortation was categorized under theater. This didnt affect my analysis as it was canceled and also filtered out for its subcategory. 
### Result
Based on 9 years of data (2009 - 2017) it is shown that theater campaigns starting in May have been the most successful while December campaings have been the least successful. See file, Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.PNG
Campaign goals set between 1000 to 5000 have resulted in successful campaigns overall. Outcome_vs_Goals.PNG
